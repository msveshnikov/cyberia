Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Develop the core game engine with isometric map rendering and integrate AI-powered property
generation to create a functional prototype of Cyberia.fun's main gameplay loop.

## Selected User Stories / Tasks

### High Priority

1. Implement basic 3D isometric grid system (8 points)

    - Create a scalable grid structure
    - Implement tile rendering logic
    - Develop camera controls for navigation

2. Set up Stable Diffusion SDXL integration (5 points)

    - Configure API connection to Stable Diffusion SDXL
    - Implement secure key management for STABILITY_KEY
    - Create basic image generation request function

3. Develop isometric style prompt engineering (5 points)

    - Research effective prompts for isometric game art
    - Create a template system for dynamic prompt generation
    - Implement prompt refinement based on tile position and surroundings

4. Implement tile generation and caching system (8 points)
    - Develop logic for requesting new tile generation
    - Create a caching mechanism for generated tiles
    - Implement efficient storage and retrieval of tile data

### Medium Priority

5. Implement smooth scrolling and navigation (5 points)

    - Develop smooth camera movement
    - Implement zoom functionality
    - Optimize performance for large map areas

6. Create user registration and login system (5 points)

    - Develop backend API for user authentication
    - Implement frontend registration and login forms
    - Set up secure session management

7. Design and implement basic user profiles (3 points)
    - Create database schema for user profiles
    - Develop API endpoints for profile CRUD operations
    - Implement basic profile UI in the frontend

## Effort Estimation

Total Story Points: 39

## Dependencies and Risks

-   Stable Diffusion SDXL API availability and performance
-   Potential challenges in optimizing isometric rendering for performance
-   Ensuring prompt engineering produces consistent and high-quality isometric tiles

## Definition of Done

-   All selected user stories are implemented and functional
-   Code is reviewed and passes all automated tests
-   Basic documentation is updated for new features
-   The game prototype runs smoothly in a development environment
-   AI-generated tiles are consistently high-quality and fit the isometric style
-   User registration, login, and basic profile management are functional
-   The isometric map can be navigated smoothly with generated tiles loading efficiently
```

This sprint plan focuses on developing the core game engine and integrating the AI-powered property
generation, which are crucial for creating a functional prototype of Cyberia.fun. The selected
tasks cover the highest priority items from the backlog, with a balance between frontend, backend,
and AI integration work.

The estimated effort uses story points, with a total of 39 points for the sprint. This is a
moderately ambitious sprint, aiming to establish the foundational elements of the game.

The main risks are related to the integration and performance of the Stable Diffusion SDXL API, as
well as potential challenges in optimizing the isometric rendering for smooth performance. The
prompt engineering task is crucial for ensuring consistent and high-quality tile generation.

The Definition of Done ensures that by the end of the sprint, we will have a functional prototype
with the core game engine, AI-generated tiles, and basic user management features in place.
