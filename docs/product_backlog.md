## Completed Items

-   Core game engine and map rendering (basic version)
-   User authentication and basic profile management
-   Property creation and placement system (initial version)

## Notes

-   WebGL rendering has been added as a high priority to improve overall game performance.
-   Progressive loading system is now a high priority to support the infinite map concept more
    efficiently.
-   Property customization tools have been moved up in priority based on user feedback.
-   The in-game economy system has been promoted to medium priority to start laying the groundwork
    for monetization.
-   VR and AR support remain low priority but are kept on the backlog for future development.
-   AI-powered NPCs and quests have been added as a new feature to enhance gameplay depth.
-   Blockchain and NFT integration remains low priority but is included for future consideration.
