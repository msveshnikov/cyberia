# Cyberia (built by [AutoCode](https://autocode.work))

Cyberia is an innovative MMO game where users can create their own 1024x1024 tiles property on a 3D
isometric infinite map using AI-generated content. The game is browser-based, initially free to
play, with monetization options planned for the future.

# TODO

-   Fix landing according to this roast video transcript (take care about all issues!!!)

yes for roast you're going to get a roast all right siberia. fun what the hell is this craft your
Jesus what a weird font craft your AI powered isometric World isometric what the does that mean BR I
don't know what that means uh I'm not that smart explore create and connect an infinite 3D Universe
3D universe that sounds cool this doesn't look this looks like a model in person I don't know I
don't understand would I understand what this is immediately no I actually don't know start your
adventure I'm not going to click Start your adventure because I don't know what exactly I'm starting
uh key features AI generated Landscapes okay that's more descripted than craft your AI powered
isometric world this makes more sense create unique 1024 x 1024 property tiles using Cutting Edge AI
technology cool get that infinite like what is the use case though what are people using this for
this is a landscape they're going to put on their background this is something they're going to play
in a game like what is what exactly is the the promise so usually up here it's like this is the
promise like the fastest way to do blah the easiest way to do blah um connect create your perfect 3D
World whatever that promise is and then the execution of the promise is like the next sign like what
exactly do you do to make sure that happens and why do you do it in a different way that's kind of
the structure that I think works really well for Stuff browser based gameplay you're naming these
features but I don't know what they are adding up to I think that's my problem um so I'd probably
scroll past that it's weird to U maybe it's just because of my yeah it's a little I would have a
even well yeah I don't know it's weird to have like a straggler you have a bunch of white space
Unleash Your creativity in Siberia your imagination is the only limit use our Advanced AI tools to
create landscape so much text architect so cber is like a game it's like a virtual world what is it
connect with the global Community make friends trade and collaborate with players worldwide you're
just saying a lot of stuff I don't know I feel like you have an idea of what this is but a random
person landing on this page has no idea what this is so when you write your copy you have to assume
that people have zero idea what it is and it's sometimes it's hard to do that that's why you hire
Consultants to do that or you hire like just go to Starbucks and ask somebody like hey what is this
we just go to Starbucks don't even hire consultant go to Starbucks and ask someone hey see them
standing in line it's like hey can I ask you something do you think you could um I'd love to buy
your coffee do you think you could give me some feedback on something I'm working on boom just get
them get them in there it works um development road map development road map I'm here to tell you
right now we don't care let me let me tell we don't care I mean tell me what's available when it's
ready like people don't care about your road map um especially on the homepage where they just they
just met you it's like you go on a first date with someone is like yep my plan is to to get married
on this time and um yeah I just picked out this dress you're like whoa like what are you talking
about um ready to shape your digital Destiny I have no idea what that means join thousands of
players ready crafting their unique worlds in Siberia so what I can piece together from the little
bits of this website that sort of make sense is that people can create a 3D world that they can
explore it is a game I believe I don't know if it's a personal I don't know because like a AI
generated landscape seems like a separate thing from like a virtual world so I honestly don't know
what this is do you have like a demo or something of what it is and maybe we could craft some copy
around what that is happy to do that but to be honest I just I really don't know what this is peace
